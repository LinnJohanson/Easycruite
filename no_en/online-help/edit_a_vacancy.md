# Edit a Vacancy

Editing a vacancy may be required after a vacancy has been published. Changes made to a vacancy only affect the vacancy itself and do not affect any candidates associated with it.

1.  From the  Toolbar  select the  Vacancy List  quick link to display the  Overview of Vacancies  page.
2.  Click on the icon with a pencil to display the  Edit Vacancy  tab.  
    Options that can be edited have icon with a pencil enabled and those that the user cannot edit have grayed out icon with pencil applied to them. Vacancy approval also affects which options can be edited. Using the  Edit Approval Status  option to unapprove a vacancy can enable other options for editing.  
      
    Note the options that can be edited with the vacancy unapproved. Note the options that can be edited with the vacancy approved.
3.  Click on the icon with a pencil to access the option to be edited and make the required changes as outlined below, then click  Save  when complete.

**[Access Control](../faq/who_has_access_to_a_vacancy.htm)**
Used to select which system users can have access to the vacancy. The list of available users is divided by departments. You can now define a user’s rights for each specific vacancy. Three different levels of access are enabled and include the following capabilities (please note this list is not exhaustive):

-   Read - Ability to view all aspects of the vacancy and the candidates within that vacancy
-   Read & Write access – Ability to view all aspects of the vacancy and ability to manage and progress candidates for that vacancy.
-   Administrative access – Ability to edit the vacancy, as well as manage and progress candidates for the vacancy.

Administrators and department administrators do not need to be given access rights and are not therefore shown in the list.

For more details on these options refer to  [Creating a Vacancy](creating_a_new_vacancy.htm).
