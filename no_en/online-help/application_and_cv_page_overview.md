# Application and CV page overview

The  Application and CV  page is accessed by selecting a candidate application for a vacancy. From this page all actions involving the candidate and the specific application for the vacancy can be tracked. The page includes a table with the information from all vacancies and also includes the following tabs:

-   [Application and CV](application_and_cv_tab.htm)  - From here the candidate can be progressed through the application process.
-   [Recruitment Activities List](recruitment_activities_list_tab.htm)  - Provides information on the different stages of the application process that the candidate has gone through.
-   [Documents/ Notes](documents_notes_tab.htm)  - From here, internal users can enter notes about the candidate and upload documents.
-   [Classification](classification_tab.htm)  - Can include the candidate's CV, application text, and responses to vacancy questions.
-   [Two-way Email](two_way_email_tab.htm)  - Includes a record of any two-way emails sent from the recruiter, initiated from EasyCruit, to the candidate.
-   [Collaborative Rating](collaborative_rating_tab.htm)  - From here, internal users can rate the candidate and add any comments/reply to other users's comments.

#### Ranking Candidates

Applicants can be manually ranked by recruiters. They can be given a ranking from one to three and can be changed whenever the recruiter wants. There can be multiple applicants for each ranking number. It is useful to rank candidates for future bulk-processing e.g. all ranking 3 candidates can be selected and rejected at once.

1.  Select the applicant to display the  Application and CV  page.
2.  From the  Ranking  list, select  Ranking 1,  Ranking 2,  Ranking 3  or  No ranking, and then click  Execute.

#### Reference Check

This question type is similar to the text types, except that the text is formatted in a heading style when it is presented to the applicant in the job advert.

1.  Select the applicant to display the  Application and CV  page.
2.  From the  Reference Check  list, select  None Implemented,  Positive,  Negative  or  None, and then click  Execute.
