# Data Extract

The Data Extract tab is available to Administrators, and an add on feature required to be activated.

1.  From the  Start  page, select  Reports  then select  Data Extract.
2.  Click  Application Extract  to display the filters.
3.  Click the name of the extract you wish to use then select your filtering criteria.
4.  Export to Excel by clicking  Click here to Generate XLSX Report.  
    The maximum date range is 1 year. If you want to use data across 2 years you will need to run 2 extracts.  
    To return to the full list of extracts click the extract again.

Depending on your web browser, you will be prompted to either open or save the file.

When the data extract file is open in Excel you can copy and paste the results into one of the EasyCruit supplied pre-configured template charts or into your own custom made chart.
