Additionally, the icon with a question mark is displayed instead of the posting end date in the column "End". Most of the job boards receive the postings once a day in the evening and will display them the next day. Other job boards receive the postings several times a day and will display them the same day.
-   In case all the posting steps were not completed, the following message is displayed "The vacancy was not posted correctly, please click on edit to complete the posting.". Additionally, the icon with a red cross is displayed instead of the posting end date in the column "End".
