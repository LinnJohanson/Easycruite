# Activating a Vacancy

Once a position has been created and saved, it still needs to be activated before potential candidates can begin viewing it on the vacancy website.

1.  Continue from the creating a vacancy procedure or select a vacancy that has not been activated and select the  Edit Vacancy  tab.
2.  If your company uses a vacancy approval system, continue to step 3, otherwise go to step 4.
3.  Click on the icon with a pencil for the  Edit approval status  option then select  Yes  for the  Do you approve this vacancy  option. Enter any required comments then click  Save.  
    For information on approving vacancies via email, if they have not already been approved, refer to  [Vacancy Approvals] (vacancy_approvals.htm).
4.  Click the  Edit  pencil for the  Publish/Multi Posting  option to display the  Selecting Posting Channels  page.  
    
5.  Select the required posting channels then click  Next  to display the  Internal Channels  page.  
    Because some job boards require additional information when a vacancy is posted, extra details can be applied for individual channels.
6.  Click  Next  to proceed to the next channel. Once all channels are configured, the  Confirm Posting  page is displayed.
7.  Click  Finish  to activate the vacancy and have it published to the listed channels. The vacancy now has a green check mark next to it.

If the vacancy is being published to an external channel, the  Keep HTML Format  option is enabled by default.
