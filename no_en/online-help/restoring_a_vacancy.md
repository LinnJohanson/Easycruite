# Restoring a Vacancy

Restoring a vacancy may be required after a vacancy has been completed or closed, if you want to re-use a vacancy. Changes made to a vacancy only affect the vacancy itself and do not affect any candidates associated with it.

Contact the Customer Success team if you do not see the restore icon, as this feature may not be activated for you.

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link to display the  Overview  of  Vacancies  page.
2.  Select the  Completed  page.
3.  Click on the icon with green restore arrows to restore the vacancy. The restored vacancy moves back to the  New and Active  page or the  Expired  page, depending on the publication period of the vacancy.
