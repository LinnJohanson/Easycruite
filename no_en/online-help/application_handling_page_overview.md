# Application Handling Page Overview

The  Application Handling  page provides a recruitment overview for a vacancy. From this entry point, the vacancy and the candidate applications for it can be managed.

The page includes tabs which cater for the following information:

-   Application Handling  - This is where candidate applications are processed and progressed through the company's recruitment workflow. You can see what stage of the recruitment process candidates are in, and by clicking on a grouping, view candidates in that stage.
-   Edit Vacancy  - Provides  [access to the vacancy](edit_a_vacancy.htm)  details and enables users with the correct access rights to modify the vacancy when required. This is also where vacancies can be published.
-   Statistics  - Includes information on each candidate who has applied for the vacancy. It displays each stage of the recruitment process and shows which stages the candidate has gone through. The Statistical Progress report, which is an additional feature, can then be exported to PDF, Excel or printed.
-   Candidate Report  - Provides access to the feature rich candidate reports. For more information refer to  [Candidate Report](candidate_report.htm).
-   Applicant list  - Provides access to regional specific functionality for running reports on applicants in Norway. For more information refer to  [Applicant List](applicant_list_report.htm).

    -   Click  All applications  to see a list of all job applicants. You can then drill down further to the tab.
