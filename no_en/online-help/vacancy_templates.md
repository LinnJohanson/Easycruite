# Vacancy Templates

Vacancy templates are a convenient method for creating reusable content for use during the recruitment process. The content derived from a vacancy template is what an applicant sees when they view an open position on a career website. When you create a new vacancy or edit an existing one you can apply a vacancy template to it, removing the need to create a new vacancy description every time a vacancy is created.

Along with standard information, such as the vacancy title and an attention grabbing one-liner, an easy to use MicrosoftÂ® Word-like editor enables content to be easily created for a vacancy. The WYSIWYG editor is a common feature used with a number of EasyCruit components. For more information on using the editor, refer to  [WYSIWYG Editor](wysiwyg_text_editor.htm).

#### Creating a Vacancy Template

1.  From the Toolbar click  Settings  then  Vacancy Templates  to display the  Vacancy Templates  page.
2.  Select the appropriate department, then click  New Template  to display the New vacancy template page. A tab is displayed for each language configured within the system.
3.  Type a name in the  Vacancy Template Name  field.
4.  In the tab section enter a  Company Name,  One-liner  and  Vacancy Title.  
    The  One-liner  is the tag line for the vacancy that should attract an applicant to it, while the  Vacancy Title  is the customer facing title for the vacancy. It can be different from the internal name for the vacancy.
5.  In the WYSIWYG editor enter and format the content for the vacancy as required. For details of how to use the editor, refer to  [WYSIWYG Editor](wysiwyg_text_editor.htm).
6.  Repeat steps 4 to 5 for each language then click  Save  when complete.
