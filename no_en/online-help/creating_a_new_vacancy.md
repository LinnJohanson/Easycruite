# Creating a new vacancy

EasyCruit provides recruiters with a vacancy creation process that is tailored to a company's specific needs. With that in mind, it is possible that the following procedure may vary slightly from your company's vacancy creation process. It is important that the EasyCruit administrator has configured the system correctly before creating vacancies.

1.  Select the  New Vacancy  quick link from the top of the page to display the  New vacancy  page. A progress bar will display to list the steps and show where you are in the vacancy creation process.  
    You can navigate between steps by clicking the steps on the progress bar. Each step will only be active if that step can be performed. For example, the  Departments  and  Contacts  step is only active after the  Title  and  Region  step has been completed.
2.  Enter a  Vacancy Title  and  Vacancy Reference Number  and select the languages in which the vacancy is available.  
      
    Vacancy Title  is used to identify the position internally and is not displayed when the vacancy is listed on the candidate website. The option is available to display the reference number with the vacancy listing. For customers who have the Automatic  Vacancy Reference Number  function enabled, the number is automatically filled in by the system.
3.  From the  Project Owner  list select the user who is responsible for the vacancy.
4.  Select the required country from the  Country  list to populate the  Region  list then select the region and click the arrow button to move the region to the  Selected Region  list. Repeat for each required region.
5.  Select a  Misc. Settings  option if required then click  Next  to display the Select Departments page.  
    The Misc. settings options enable you to:  
    
    -   Include ratings and comments about a candidate (Use Collaborative Rating for this Project).
    -   Use test results to provide feedback (Use Service-F for this recruitment,  Use Matrigma for this recruitment,  Use MINT for this recruitment, and so on).
    -   Store candidate data relating to the application.
    
      
    Visma EasyCruit can then generate an applicant ranking list based on the feedback or test results.
6.  Click  Next  to display the  Departments and Contacts  page.
7.  From the  Select Departments  list, select the departments for which the vacancy applies.
8.  If there is not already a contact person, in the  Add Contact  section enter the details for the vacancy's contact person and click  Add  
    - or -  
    Click  Retrieve  to display the available users window, select the required user to automatically populate the  Add Contact  fields, and then click  Add.
9.  Select  Contact in ad  for the user whose contact details are to be shown in the job advert then click  Next.
10.  Select  Sender  for the user you want to be used as the default person for email communications.
11.  Select  Notification  for the user you want to be used as the default person for notifications of applicants.
12.  If required select  Tick this if you want the contacts email to be visible in the published vacancy  and click  Next.
13.  If any questions have been added the  Project Profile  page will be displayed. Enter the required answers then click  Next  to display the  Vacancy Ad  page.
14.  On the  Vacancy Ad  page you can create a completely new vacancy by filling in the required fields or choose a template and click  Select.
    
    -   Vacancy Templates  - This option provides a list of vacancy templates to choose from. For more details on templates refer to  [Vacancy Template](vacancy_templates.htm).
    -   Previous Vacancies  - This option enables any previously created vacancy to be used as a template.  
          
        
    
    Ensure that any vacancy specific details, such as titles and dates are changed to correspond to the new vacancy.
15.  Enter the following details for the vacancy for each language and click  Preview  to review the vacancy listing:
    -   Company Name  - The company name is automatically populated, but can be replaced if required.
    -   One Liner  - This is the tag line displayed above the vacancy that should draw candidates to the vacancy.
    -   Vacancy Title  - This is the title of the vacancy as it is displayed on the vacancy website. This value is mandatory.
    -   Application Deadline  - This is the last day that applications are accepted for the position.
    -   Expected Start Date  - This can be a specific date or a term such as "ASAP".
    -   Location  - The location of the vacancy.
    -   Appetizer text  and  Vacancy text  - This is the content of the applicant listing created using the  [WYSIWYG editor.](wysiwyg_text_editor.htm)
16.  When the vacancy details are complete click  Next  to display the  Application Form  page.
17.  Select one of the following new application form options or select  No Form  to include an application form with the vacancy listing on the website:
    -   Complete Application Form  - Only select this option if you want to have every value that has been included in the CV database for your company included on the application form. Selecting this can lead to a very large list and should only be specified for highly technical positions.
    -   Select Application Template  - This option provides a list of application templates that have been configured by the administrator. These templates can be set up to be position or department specific and reduce the effort required by a recruiter when creating a vacancy.
    -   Customized Application Form and CV  - This option enables the recruiter to create a one-off vacancy specific application form.  
          
        EasyCruit can be configured to limit the ability to edit application forms. Non-administrator users may not be able to edit application form options; in that instance the application form is read-only.
18.  Click  Next  and where required select the options to be included on the application form, selecting whether they are to be  Mandatory.
19.  Click  Next  to display the  Screening  page.
20.  If necessary, click  Add Question  to add a new screening question and complete the required questions as described in  [Configuring Additional Questions](additional_questions.htm).
21.  Click  Next  to display the  Response Mail  page and click pencil icon to activate the required response emails then click  Save.
22.  Click  Next  to display the  Posting  page and select the channels you want to post to. If multiposting has been activated for your EasyCruit implementation this page will enable you to select the required posting channels as described in  [Multiposting](multiposting.htm).
23.  Click  Next  to display the  Approving of Vacancy  page and select a user from the  Recipient  list who is responsible for approving the vacancy before it can be published.  
      
    Using an approver is optional. It is possible that your company's vacancy creation process does not include this step.
24.  Click  Next  then click  Finish  and  Post  to post the vacancy and display the  Edit Vacancy  page.  
      
    At this point the vacancy has been saved in EasyCruit and can be activated and made available on the company's website, or further edits can be made, such as providing other users  [access to the vacancy](../faq/who_has_access_to_a_vacancy.htm), or setting up  Project Profile Questions.
