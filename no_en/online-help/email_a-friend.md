# Email a Friend

1.  Login to an EasyCruit client, as an admin level user.
2.  From the  Toolbar  select  Settings  then click  Response Mails.
3.  Scroll to the bottom of the section headed  Other.
4.  Click on the icon with a pencil next to the  Send to a Friend email.
5.  You can select a department from the dropdown list and set a specific email template for that department.
6.  Complete the  Subject,  Contents  and  Signature  fields.
7.  Save the template so that when a candidate clicks the  Send to a friend  link, any advertisements made by the department that you selected in Step 5 now have the associated response email template set up.
