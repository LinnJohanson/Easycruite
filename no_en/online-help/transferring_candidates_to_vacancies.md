# Transferring Candidates to Vacancies

When a candidate is added to the system and after they have been included in candidate search results, they can be added to new or existing vacancies. Applicants that are already associated with a vacancy can be transferred to other existing vacancies, but only via candidate search results can applicants be transferred to a new vacancy.

## Transferring Candidates to a New Vacancy

1.  Run a search as described in  [Searching for Candidates](../getting-started/searching_for_candidates.htm).
2.  On the  Candidate Search  page, select one or more candidates to transfer.
3.  From the  Further Progress  list select Transfer and setup a new vacancy then click  Execute.
4.  The  New Vacancy  page is displayed and a new vacancy needs to be created, as described in  Creating a Vacancy.
5.  After the contacts have been identified, the following page is used to designate which candidates are transferred to the new vacancy and in which department if applicable.
6.  When the vacancy has been created, select the vacancy from the  Vacancy List  then click  All Applications  to view and confirm that the candidates have been included.

## Transferring Candidates to an Existing Vacancy

1.  Run a search as described in Searching for Candidates.
2.  On the  Candidate Search  page, select one or more candidates to transfer.
3.  From the  Further Progress  list select  Transfer to vacancy project  then click  Execute.
4.  On the  Transfer  page, use the  Status,  Vacancy  and  Department  lists to select the correct vacancy.
5.  Select  Copy this data (do not move)  if you want to if you want to copy the candidate details to the selected vacancy while keeping them associated with the original vacancy as well. If you do not select this option, the candidate is transferred to the selected vacancy and removed from the original vacancy.  
    You can also select which of the applications are copied and can include any cover letter if required - this is useful if someone has applied for more than one vacancy.
