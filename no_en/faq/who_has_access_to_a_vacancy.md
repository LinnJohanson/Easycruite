# Who has access to a vacancy

When you create a  Vacancy  in EasyCruit, there are a group of users that automatically are granted rights to the vacancy:

-   Administrators  always automatically access all vacancies in EasyCruit.
-   Department Administrators  automatically have access to all Vacancies in all the departments they belong to (Defined in their User Access)
-   Each Vacancy has a  project owner. The owner has full access to the vacancy.

## Give access to other users

These three roles are responsible for giving other users access to the vacancy, which can be done from the  Access Control  Page of a vacancy.

1.  As an  Administrator  or  Project Owner, go to the  Vacancy list.
2.  Click on the pencil symbol next to the  Vacancy  (or from within the  Vacancy, click on the  Edit vacancy  tab).
3.  Click the pencil symbol next to  Access Control.
4.  Select the user access level for individual users. Click  Save.
    -   Block access  - The user will not be able to see the vacancy at all in EasyCruit.
    -   Administrator access  - The user will have full admin rights to the vacancy, including the right to change the response emails and vacancy.
    -   Read and write (Normal)  - The user will be able to progress candidates.
    -   Read only access  - The user will have the ability to view all aspects of the vacancy and the candidates within the vacancy but not edit or progress candidates.
5.  Ask the users to log out and log in again to activate the new access.

## Someone can't see the project even though they have access to department

Make sure that the user is added to the vacancy on the Access Control page. Remember that the users need to log out and in again in order for changes to be activated.

## I canâ€™t find the person I need to give access to

The  Access Control  page displays a list of users. The list shows all the users that have access to the department(s) in the vacancy, and excludes  Administrators  and the  Project Owner.

Normal users need to be members of the department in order to be visible in the list. For example, if a user only belongs to Department A, the user will not be on the access control page for a vacancy in Department B. To add a user to a department:

1.  Click  Settings  in EasyCruit.
2.  Open  Users  and click on the pencil icon next to the user (or open the user and click  Edit).
3.  Open the  Department membership  tab.
4.  Select the department that the project is created under, and click the  Add department  button.
5.  Save and return to the vacancy list to edit the access control again.
