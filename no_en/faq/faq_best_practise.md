## GDPR for Visma EasyCruit

GDPR is the new privacy law that will apply to all members of the EU and EEA from May 25, 2018.

For recruitment this means to improve the protection of personal data, enable the candidates to know what happens to their personal data if they give their consent for companies to use and process it for recruitment purposes, and also ensure their right to withdraw their consent and have their personal data deleted.

The new law applies from May 25th 2018, and this letter reflects the current situation today with EasyCruit, and how we will continue improvements to support you on GDPR:  [https://info.easycruit.com/files/GDPR_for_Visma_EasyCruit.pdf](https://info.easycruit.com/files/GDPR_for_Visma_EasyCruit.pdf)

In the release in April we will provide you with the new setup for the Consent text/Privacy Policy, that will be mandatory for all customers from 2nd of May 2018. With the release in April 2018, we will show you how to do this changes.

If you do not have a consent text today, a privacy policy text will be implemented from  Visma. This text is adjustable and will be available in the following languages: English, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Italian, German, French, Danish, Swedish, Latvian, Dutch and Finnish.

Take a look at this video, that will explain how you need to prepare for the new Consent Handling:

### The advert has not been published to Finn.no - What can I do?

Sometimes when an advert is posted, it does not appear on Finn.no. In most cases when an advert is not visible on Finn.no, this is something you can fix on your own. Here is a list of a few things you can check.

### Publication period max 6 weeks

The first thing to check is how long ago the vacancy first was published. If you have reused a project from last year, this may be the issue, as the first publication started a year ago.

One advert can't be displayed on Finn.no for more than  42 days (6 weeks) from the date the vacancy first was published. If this period is exceeded, the advert may not be published at all.

If the gap is more than 42 days, you will need to request a second advert to be created. You can easily do this by ticking the box Request new Finnkode. This will create a new Finn-code (a new advert). Note that Finn.no will charge you for a new advert when you do this, so this step may require approval from your manager.

[![](../Resources/Images/finnkode_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/finnkode.jpg)

### Postcode must be valid

Make sure to use a valid postcode. To check and update the application date go to  Edit Vacancy  and click the pencil next to  Publish to board, and  then the pencil next to Finn.no. You can search in the Norwegian postcode directory from the following link:

[http://adressesok.posten.no/en/postal_codes/search](http://adressesok.posten.no/en/postal_codes/search)

Here is an example: If you post a vacancy with postcode 0007 Oslo (see the below screenshot), the advert will not be published.

[![](../Resources/Images/finn_posten_no_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/finn_posten_no.jpg)

### Check the application date

Sometimes the application date has the wrong month or wrong year. The application date also should be in the standard Norwegian format DD.MM.YYYY, if you need to check and update the application date go to  Edit Vacancy  and click the pencil next to  Vacancy.

[![](../Resources/Images/application_date_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/application_date.jpg)

### Is the contract still valid?

In order to post to Finn.no a contract with Finn.no AS is required. If you have questions regarding your contract, please call your contact person at Finn.no. You can also contact their support. You'll find contact information here:  [https://hjelpesenter.finn.no](https://hjelpesenter.finn.no/)

![Closed](../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Add a video to job advertisement

It is possible to add a video to your advertisement in EasyCruit, by embedding the video code from an online video provider like  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)  or  [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). In this article we will show you how you can do it.

Note that some external job boards do not support this type of video embedding on their pages, which is outside the control of EasyCruit.

### Copy the embed code

The first thing you need to do when you want to add a video to EasyCruit, is to upload your video file to a web page. In this example we have uploaded our video to  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEBcbsNlY2Y).

When the video is ready click the  Share button  on the video page, and select  Embed. Select all the text (the entire URL) in the box below, right click and click  copy.

[![](../Resources/Images/copy_code_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/copy_code.jpg)

The text to copy should look something like this:

[![](../Resources/Images/copy_code2_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/copy_code2.jpg)

Depending on the width of your company homepage, you may want to modify the height and width properties for the iframe in order to make the video fit in. Be aware that for mobile sites the fixed size of the iframe might be an issue.

### Insert the iframe to the vacancy

-   Go to the  vacancy list  in EasyCruit.
-   Click the  pencil next to the vacancy title  and then click  the pencil next to Vacancy  to edit the text in the advert.
-   In the toolbar there is a button called  HTML. Click this one. A little window pops up.
-   Paste the embedding code in the preferred position within the HTML-code.
-   Click  Update  and then  Save.

![Closed](../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Attach a Cover Letter

### A Candidate Forgot to Attach a Cover Letter

Unfortunately candidates cannot do this themselves. There are two options available - the Candidate sends the cover letter to you and you update their application manually in EasyCruit, or you ask the candidate to re-apply (and delete their old application).

### Edit CV and Upload Manually

Normally when candidates wish to update their CV information, you can ask them to log in to your career site. However, candidates can only update information in the CV (the information that can be used across all the different applications). Information specific to the application within a project (for example the cover letter, project specific questions or additional attachments) cannot be updated in the system by the candidates themselves.

In order to change a cover letter for a candidate, the best thing to do is to save the candidate application to your CV database. Saving the candidate enables you to edit the candidate’s information on their behalf.

To do this, follow these simple steps:

1.  Ask the candidate to send the information or attachments to you via email.
2.  Open the candidate in EasyCruit. Click  Select future progress. Select  Save application. Press the  Execute  button.  
      
      
      
    After saving the candidate, a new button appears to the right. Click the  Edit CV button.
3.  Multiple tabs open up. The tab called  Application  contains the cover letter. Click the tab and add the information required.
4.  Click  Save and go to vacancy.

### Apply Again

Alternatively, if you wish, you could also ask the candidates to apply again. Here are the steps for the best practice when doing so:

1.  Confirm with the candidate that the application will be deleted and they will have to apply again.
2.  View the list of applications.
3.  Click the bin next to the candidate.
4.  Go to the start page. Open Deleted Applications. Select the candidate, scroll down to the bottom and choose Delete permanently.
5.  Tell the candidate they may apply again using the updated information.

![Closed](../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Who Has Access to a Vacancy

When you create a Vacancy in EasyCruit, there are a group of users that automatically are granted rights to the vacancy:

-   Administrators  always automatically access all vacancies in EasyCruit.
-   Department Administrators  automatically have access to all Vacancies in all the departments they belong to (Defined in their User Access)
-   Each Vacancy has a project owner. The owner has full access to the vacancy.

### Give access to other users

These three roles are responsible for giving other users access to the vacancy, which can be done from the  Access Control Page  of a vacancy.

1.  As an Administrator or Project Owner, go to the  Vacancy list
2.  Click on the pencil symbol next to the Vacancy (or from within the Vacancy, click on the  Edit vacancy tab).
3.  Click the pencil symbol next to  Access Control.
4.  Select the user access level for individual users. Click  Save.
    -   Block access  - The user will not be able to see the vacancy at all in EasyCruit.
    -   Administrator access  - The user will have full admin rights to the vacancy, including the right to change the response emails and vacancy.
    -   Read and write (Normal)  - The user will be able to progress candidates.
    -   Read only access  - The user will have the ability to view all aspects of the vacancy and the candidates within the vacancy but not edit or progress candidates.
5.  Ask the users to log out and log in again to activate the new access.

### Someone can't see the project even though they have access to department

Make sure that the user is added to the vacancy on the  Access Control page. Remember that the users need to log out and in again in order for changes to be activated.

### I can’t find the person I need to give access to

The  Access Control page  displays a list of users. The list shows all the users that have access to the department(s) in the vacancy, and excludes  Administrators  and the  Project Owner.

Normal users need to be members of the department in order to be visible in the list. For example, if a user only belongs to Department A, the user will not be on the access control page for a vacancy in Department B. To add a user to a department:

1.  Click  Settings  in EasyCruit.
2.  Open  Users  and click on the pencil icon next to the user (or open the user and click  Edit).
3.  Open the  Department membership  tab.
4.  Select the department that the project is created under, and click the  Add department  button.
5.  Save and return to the vacancy list to edit the access control again.

#### No application link

### Why can't candidates see send application/ apply link?

There are two possible reasons why you cannot see the Send application link in the vacancy posting:

1.  No application form was chosen for the vacancy
2.  The vacancy is linked to two departments, and a department has not yet been selected

### No application form was chosen for the vacancy

When setting up a vacancy you need to choose an Application form in order for candidates to be able to see the link to send application. To check to see if you did set one up, from the Edit Vacancy tab of a vacancy, click the eye icon.

### Adding an application form

To add an application form, click on the pencil icon next to  Application form  from the  Edit Vacancy  tab

Choose either complete, from a template or a custom application form and edit it to suit your project if you need to. Remember, the changes you make will only apply to this project.

### Multiple departments

Another reason the  Send Application  link may not show could be because the project is assigned to two or more different departments.

If so, the candidate needs to choose a department before the  Send application  link will appear.

#### Failed Login

When you have tried to log in to EasyCruit 3 times with incorrect login details, you will be required to fill in a CAPTCHA code similar to the below. This is to protect EasyCruit from malicious attacks. The CAPTCHA code is case sensitive.

[![](../Resources/Images/login_failed_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/login_failed.jpg)

There is no way around entering the code! Do not try to re-load the page!

If you have failed logging in 3 times, and then re-load the page, the CAPTCHA image will not show, but the system will remember that you had 3 failed attempts so will not let you login.

Once you have filled in the code and your login credentials correctly you will get into EasyCruit.

#### Finn.no - no button to apply

### There is no application button in my advert at Finn.no

Example of application button in the right column.Sometimes when you post to Finn.no you may experience that the application button that usually can be found in the right column is not there, or that you receive emails from Finn.no with applications from candidates.

[![](../Resources/Images/search_fi_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/search_fi.jpg)

The reason for this can usually be found in the configuration for the vacancy. Follow the simple steps below to resolve the issue:

### Check that the application link has been sent

When you post a vacancy to Finn.no from EasyCruit, you will be asked if you wish to send the application link. This is a yes/no question. If you wish for the application button to appear on the Finn.no webpage, you need to select yes here. Here's how:

-   Open the vacancy from the  Vacancy list  and select  Edit vacancy.
-   Click the pencil next to  Publish2board, and then the pencil next to  Finn.no.
-   Make sure that you have selected  yes (ja)  for the link.  
      
    [![](../Resources/Images/search_fi_2_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/search_fi_2.jpg)  
    

-   Click  Next  and then  Finish.
-   Wait for 20 minutes while  Finn.no  updates the advert.

### Make sure that there is an application form in the vacancy

The project needs to have an application form configured in order to display an application button in the Finn.no advert. Here is how to check that you have an application form in the vacancy:

1.  Open the vacancy from the Vacancy list and select Edit vacancy.
2.  Click the eye next to Application form.
3.  The application form will open and show you a list of all the questions in it.
4.  If the application form is empty, you will need to create a new one.
    -   Go back and click the pencil next to Application form.
    -   Select the desired type, and click next.
    -   Configure the questions you want and click save.
5.  If there already is an application form in the vacancy, you may still wish to re-publish the vacancy to make sure this has been sent to Finn.no.
    -   To re-publish, click the pencil next to Publish2board, and then the pencil next to  Finn.no.
    -   Click  Next  and then  Finish.
    -   Wait for 20 minutes while Finn.no updates the advert.

#### Updates to Vacancy

### I've made a change to my vacancy but I can't see them on the channels

When you edit a vacancy after it has been published, you need to publish it again to update the web pages with the new information. Here are the simple steps to edit and update a vacancy:

-   To edit a vacancy, open the vacancy from the vacancy list and press  Edit Vacancy.
-   Make your changes and click  Save.
-   Click on the pencil next to  Publish2Board/Multiposting.
-   Select the active posting channels (those with dates) and click  Next.
-   Finally click  Next  and  Finish.

Some channels are hosted on the easycruit.com server. The changes you make will take effect immediately when you post to these.

Some channels are transferring data to a page hosted on another server. In EasyCruit these channels are grouped under the heading  External Channels. For external channels you can usually expect a delay before the advert is visible online. Most of these pages automatically update every 15 minutes or so, but some pages update less frequently, for instance once every 12 hours. This will depend on the channel, and is not controlled by EasyCruit.

For  Multiposting channels  you need to edit the channel and tick the option called  Update  before clicking  Send. The Multiposting channels will normally update almost immediately and the green ON icon indicates that the web page has received the information. If there is an error message, you can simply hold the mouse over the red error sign to view a tooltip with the error message.

### I tried to change the dates for the vacancy but I can’t see the changes on the channels

To change the  Apply by date  you need to perform the following steps:

1.  Open the vacancy from the  Vacancy list  and click  Edit Vacancy  and click the pencil next to  Vacancy.
2.  Edit the apply by-date field and press  Save.
3.  Click on the pencil next to  Publish2Board/Multiposting.
4.  Select the active posting channels (those with dates) and click  Next.
5.  Finally click  Next  and  Finish.

To change the publication dates you can follow these steps:

1.  Open the vacancy from the  Vacancy list  and click  Edit Vacancy.
2.  Click on the pencil next to  Publish2Board/Multiposting.
3.  Select the active posting channels (those with dates) and click  Next.
4.  Change the dates for each channel. Then click  Next  and  Finish.
5.  Multiposting channels  needs to be stopped before you can update the publication dates.

Please keep in mind that some providers will consider this to be a new posting, and therefore charge you for one extra vacancy credit.

#### Vacancy appears on channels I haven't posted to

Search engines and job board/ channel 'spiders' can display publicly listed jobs on their own sites. This article describes how this occurs and how you can restrict it from happening.

### Why do my vacancies/ jobs advertisements appear in places I haven't posted to?

Some sites (e.g. Indeed) use a  spider  to trawl through career sites and publish jobs on their own website. If a candidate clicks on the link from Indeed, it will divert the candidate back to the original source/ channel where the job was posted to (most likely your career site), and the candidate will be registered in EasyCruit as coming from your career site, rather than Indeed.

### How can I prevent my vacancy/ job advertisement displaying on sites I haven't posted to?

The EasyCruit Customer Success Team can configure your career site to request such sites not to index or include pages, by setting the robots.txt file to  no robots, and amend the career site pages accordingly. If you have created your own career site using the EasyCruit XML feed, you will need to undertake these changes yourself. Unfortunately not all search engines or job boards respect this listing, in which case you should contact them directly.

If you have jobs which are internal only, and not for the general public, you should post these jobs to a dedicated internal career site, and the EasyCruit Customer Success Team can restrict access to the site in the following ways:

1.  .IP restriction - the only people able to access the site and therefore jobs are those who are connected to the specified IP address, e.g. over VPN or internal network.
2.  Login - a user name and password is required for people to access the internal career site. This could also be used to restrict access for Recruitment Agencies, so the agency can view jobs you want them to recruit for, and they enter candidates directly themselves.

#### Can I change the company name?

### Is it Possible to Change the name of a Company?

Sometimes the name of an organisation changes. To change the name of your company in EasyCruit please contact the Customer Success Team via phone or email  [support@easycruit.com](mailto:support@easycruit.com). They will be ready to assist you.

1.  You can check what your current company name is by opening  Settings  >  Company information.

#### Change logo / image

### How to change the logo / department image

To change the main company logo/image an Administrator can do this under  Settings  >  Company Information  and then select the  Media  tab.

For all other departments it can be done by an Administrator or Department Administrator under  Settings  >  Departments.

1.  Under settings, chose departments and edit the department you want to give another logo
2.  Under the tab Logo / Images you will see the current logo and image being used.
3.  Chose a file and upload it.  Remember to Save!

If there is no image uploaded, the department will inherit the parent Department or Company image.

#### Spontaneous / general applications

### Best practice for handling spontaneous/general applications

Spontaneous/ general applications are used to capture candidates who are interested in working for your organization in EasyCruit, without there being a current specific role for them to apply to. This can enable you to see who is interested in working for your organization, and build up a talent pool of potential candidates who you can contact when a suitable vacancy becomes available.

There are two ways this can be facilitated in EasyCruit

1.  Using the  [Candidate Career Centre](../online-help/candidate_career_centre.htm)
2.  Creating a specific vacancy and posting it to a specific channel

### Using the Candidate Career Center for spontaneous applications

Candidates who have created a profile in the Career Center will be displayed as 'CV Candidates' in EasyCruit. You can search for candidates against that candidate type, and reach out to them via email, or link them to a suitable vacancy as one arises.

Candidates are only able to submit 'standard' profile data through the career center. If you have specific questions you want to ask spontaneous applicants, it may be better to set up a specific vacancy for them.

### Creating a specific vacancy and posting it to a specific channel

The benefits of this method are:

-   You can create a specific button on your career site for spontaneous applications
-   You can specify the questions you want to ask in the application form for spontaneous applications
-   Based on answers to your specific questions, you are better able to search for candidates

[![](../Resources/Images/vacancies_thumb_120_0.jpg)](../Resources/Images/vacancies.jpg)

#### Logout

### Why do I get logged off the system?

For security reasons, EasyCruit has a standard Time-out functionality. It means that if you are not actively working in the system, you will get logged out after 30 min. This time limit is not changeable per customer.

### Does the system auto-save?

There is no specific auto save, and EasyCruit requires you to physically click the save or next buttons to progress your work.

If you experience getting logged off in the middle of setting up a new project, your project will get automatically saved as long as you have assigned a department to the project. You can always come back and continue working/editing your project after this.

### My vacancy text wasn't saved

Note: Editing within a text field does not count as activity, and this might be why you feel you are getting logged off despite working in the system. This can be problematic when you are editing the content of your vacancy, therefore, when entering longer text/ formatting in text boxes, we recommend you actively save frequently.

### I'm getting logged out shorter than 30 minutes

This could be due to your IP address changing. This may occur if you VPN, or if a session cookie is deleted for any reason. It's best to contact your internal IT department if you face more frequent log outs, as it could be due to your internet settings.

#### Which Features are Activated for My EasyCruit?

EasyCruit Administrators can see which features have been purchased and activated.

1.  From the Toolbar select  Settings  then  Company Information.
2.  Click  My EasyCruit  to display the listing of available packages.  
    A number beside the package shows you how many features are activated. If the package displays a green tick, all the features have been activated.
3.  Select a package name to expand it and display the feature list.

#### Emails to multiple recipients - are recipients visible to others?

### I am sending out an email to multiple recipients. Will they see each other's email addresses?

No, you have nothing to worry about. When you are sending emails to several candidates at the same time in EasyCruit, you can always feel safe that EasyCruit sends a separate email to each of the email addresses in the list. The system will not be sending them as CC or BCC, but as individual emails.

#### Unsubscribing an Administrator from unwanted EasyCruit emails

Are you receiving emails about system updates, but do not require these emails any more because you have left the position or organization?

### How to unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe from the EasyCruit mailing list by contacting our Customer Success Team on  [support@easycruit.com](mailto:support@easycruit.com)

#### Information regarding integration to Arbetsförmedlingen

07.10.2016

Arbetsförmedlingen is currently developing a new matching service between job and job seeker. The changes means that you for example will be able to specify the competencies that are sought for the job. Corresponding to this, a job seeker will be able to add what skills you have to get better results in the match.

Arbetsförmedelingen currently working on building up a database with various competencies for this. When this is done, the function for direct transmitted ads (that EasyCruit use to publish to them) will be updated so that you can easily identify them when publishing.

Direct Transferred ads are scheduled to be updated in 2017 with the test environment available from the first quarter. We at Visma will of course update the integration as soon as it becomes available so that you can take advantage of the new functionality as soon as possible.

You can already ensure that the database of competencies is as complete as possible, by in the ad itself add the skills you are looking for before you publish. For Arbetsförmedlingen should be able to identify those, they recommend that skills are presented in a structured way, such as a bullet list.

If you have any questions, you are welcome to contact our support.
