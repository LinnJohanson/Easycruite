# Save Applications in Candidate Career Centre

Candidates can save their applications part way through in the Career Centre, so they can continue it at a later stage. This provides a positive candidate experience so they can for example start on a mobile device and finish on a PC, or alternatively continue once they have all additional information they may need, saving candidates time as they do not need to enter the information again.

## Saving Application

1.  Candidate starts the application process and fills in the application form. Candidate can click  Save application  and continue later at any point in the application process.
2.  A candidate must have a Career Centre login to save. If the candidate is already logged into Career Centre at the beginning of the application process, the application is saved straight away. If not, the candidate will be asked to login or create a new user login; after which, the application is saved.
3.  Candidate accesses Career Centre to find the list of saved applications.
4.  Candidate receives a notification email with Career Centre information and where to find theirs saved applications. See  [Response Emails](response_emails.htm)  article for more information about how to setup the Application Saved notification email.

## Manage saved applications

Candidate can manage the list of saved applications.

1.  Candidate can continue a saved application. At any time the candidate can save their application again.
2.  Candidate can remove any saved applications.
