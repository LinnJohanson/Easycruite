# Users: Access Controls

EasyCruit Access control rights are used to manage the levels of access users have to the system. By default there are three levels of access: complete access, mid-level access and limited access. A fourth type of access - department administrator access - is dependent on your implementation using the department administrator module. These levels should cater for a typical implementation of EasyCruit, but the ability to fully customize access levels exists by simply selecting or clearing access options. This enables the system to accurately reflect the organizational requirements of a company.

There must be at least one user designated as an administrator within the EasyCruit system at all times.

The four levels of access, in default form, can be used as follows:

-   Complete Access  - This level of access should be given to the administrators of the EasyCruit system and by default they have administrator rights enabled. These users are responsible for setting up other users in the system and for managing different objects in the system that are used in the recruitment process.
-   Department Administrator Access  - This level of access typically provides a user with complete access levels of control to only those departments to which the user belongs. This includes the ability to create new users and configure other recruitment objects for those specific departments.
-   Mid-level Access  - This level of access enables the user to manage all of the day to day tasks of the recruitment process. This user can partake in all recruitment activities, with the exception of making a job offer and can also post jobs and use the various communication options. In a larger organization this access level suits senior recruiters who must be able to complete their recruiter tasks, without having to get involved in setting up and managing the recruiter environment.
-   Limited Access  - This level of access would be applicable to junior recruiters who would be responsible for specific applications and candidates. While they can do standard tasks, such as adding candidates, rejecting applicants and publishing vacancies, they cannot move applicants between projects or have access to CV search.
