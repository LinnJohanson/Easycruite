# Application Form

The Application form captures information from a candidate enabling EasyCruit users to assess the Candidate's suitability for a vacancy and what further progress should be undertaken for that Candidate.

## Application Form Format

The  Application Form  can be designed for your career site to be:

-   One Page - where all questions are listed in one page
-   In Sections - where questions are separated into sections for the candidate to complete in smaller parts
-   Responsive - fields and formatting designed to adjust to fit the size of screen it's being displayed on - Tablet or Smart Phone.

## Application Form Questions

The questions which display on the Application Form can be configured at a variety of levels:

-   EasyCruit Consultants  - when implementing your EasyCruit account, EasyCruit Consultants configure which standard questions are made available for your organization. Some organizations may want to include a Date of Birth question, where as other organizations do not want this question to be available
-   EasyCruit Administrators  - can configure additional, non standard questions, and can mark them as compulsory for all vacancies. These questions are searchable, and can also be configured for screening candidates. Watch the video below, and refer to for more information.

-   Vacancy Specific Questions  - can be tailored for a given vacancy. Watch the video below, and refer to for more information.

## Submit Application Link/Apply Link
