# Job Distribution - Multiposting

## The Situation

Job boards are among the top three sources of hire today, and 19% of hires come from a job board.

LinkedIn Global Recruiting Trends for 2015 identified that sourcing is the top priority amongst Talent Acquisition Leaders.

1. Recruiting/sourcing highly-skilled talent - 46%

2. Improving quality of hire - 34%

3. Improving sourcing techniques - 25%

## The Challenge and Business Impact

Getting a job advert 'out there' to many different job boards can have a host of challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the time it takes to post a job to the various different job boards one by one. This results in a lot of wasted time spent by recruiters.

Many of the generic job boards do not target the specific candidate profiles you may be looking for, which could result in receiving many unqualified candidates for a position, increasing the amount of time recruiters and managers need to spend screening candidates.

## The Solution

EasyCruit's integrated multiposting solution enables jobs to be posted to multiple sites simultaniously; significantly reducing the time required to post to jobs, as common filter criteria for the various job boards are entered once.

Our integrated solution provides a large coverage of generalist and specialised boards, with over 350 job boards, 650 school and university networks across 80 countries. Being able to easily post to niche job boards help target job advertisements toward qualified candidates, and reduce the number of unqualified candidates.

With over 15 million jobs posted in 2014, our partner Multiposting.fr can safely be relied upon.
