# Departments

Departments enable a company's internal structure to be replicated within EasyCruit, and can be used to accommodate companies with multiple brands.

Departments use similar settings to those used for company information, with only the additional requirement to designate a parent department needed. Within the hierarchical structure that can be created by using departments in EasyCruit, departments can inherit the settings of their parent departments, leading up to the settings contained in company information.

Departments can also be used to control user access. When creating a new user, you can designate the departments to which the user can view and manage recruits. For more information on creating users refer to  [Creating a User] (users_create_edit_delete.htm).

To view the administrator for a department hover over the icon in the  Department Administrator column.

#### Creating a New Department

2.  Click  New department  to display the  Company Information  tab.
3.  Enter a name for the department in the  Department Name  field and select a parent department from the  Parent Department  list.  
    Only the department name needs to be entered before it can be saved and used. The parent department options provide any required missing values.
4.  Refer to  [Entering Company Information] (company_information.htm)  for details on entering the remaining information.

4.  Select one of the options for deleting the department (Automatically move all data or Manually move all data).

    Manually  - to move selected candidates, vacancies or candidates to different departments (I.e. some vacancies from department X you can move to department Y, others you can move to Z or Q – and likewise for users and candidates).
