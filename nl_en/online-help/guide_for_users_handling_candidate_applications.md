# Handling Candidate Applications

After vacancies have been activated and sent to the career websites and various publishing channels, candidates can begin applying for them. This leads to the application handling stage of the recruitment process in EasyCruit. There are a number of features and pieces of functionality in the system that can be used during this process and this chapter describes how you can make use of them.

Both multiple applicants and single applicants can be managed at the same time. Typically, successful candidates who move through the various interview stages are handled separately, while handling multiple clients at the same time is an effective way to move candidates from a filled vacancy.
