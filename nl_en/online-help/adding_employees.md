    -   Department  - This field is mandatory and is the department in which the employee works.
    -   Language  - This field is mandatory and is limited to the languages available in the system.
    -   Sector  - This relates to the Job Sector options. For more information refer to  [Job Categories](job_categories.htm).
    -   Start Date/End Date  - The employee should have a start date as a minimum.
    -   Personal information  - This includes the employee's name and email address.

2.  From the  Further Progress  list, select Import list of co-workers then click  Execute.
3.  From the list select any fields to be included then click  Add.
4.  Use the arrows and X buttons to remove and re-arrange the columns for the import then click  Next.
5.  Click  Browse  to navigate to the required Microsoft Excel file. If the first row in your file contains header information, you can click the  Exclude the first row of the Excel-sheet  option.

    The Excel sheets must have the information in each column in the same order as has been designated in EasyCruit for the data to be imported correctly. This does not work with the latest version of MicrosoftÂ® Excel. If you wish to use it, you must save the file as a 1997-2003 format Excel file first.
