# Candidate Career Centre

As part of the EasyCruit career website, customers have the option of including a Candidate Career Center.

The web address for a career centre is [insert companyname].easycruit.com/career-center/login/

## What can candidates do from the Career Center?

The Candidate Career Center provides candidates with the ability to:

-   Create a profile with their CV information, which you can then use for searching for future roles
-   Register for a Job Agent email notification of jobs which match their preferences
-   Continue their saved applications
-   Show vacancies which match their profile, or all vacancies, and from there, apply

## What are the benefits of the Career Center?

### Build a talent pool, and save sourcing costs

Candidates who register their CV and personal details in the Career Center will be searchable within EasyCruit for use in future positions. You can then contact them as and when suitable positions become available.

### Save candidates time

Candidates who have signed in via the Career Center will save time when applying for positions on your career website, as any information they have already entered will pre-populate into the application form.

### Ensure candidate information is up to date

Candidates can update their profile, ensuring you always have the most up to date information about the candidate.
