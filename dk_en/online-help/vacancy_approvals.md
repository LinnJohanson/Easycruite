# Vacancy Approvals

Approval of vacancies is an option that needs to be specifically enabled for each EasyCruit system. When this option is available it adds another stage to the vacancy creation workflow. It requires specific approvers to be set up for each department, and these approvers must approve any vacancy created for their department.

Vacancy approval works on two different levels in EasyCruit:

-   If simple vacancy approval is enabled, the vacancy can still be edited while waiting for approval. This is best used as a notification mechanism that a vacancy is going to be activated and published.
-   If enforced vacancy approval is enabled, then no details can be edited while the vacancy is waiting for approval. The approval status would need to be overridden by an EasyCruit administrator to become editable again.

We recommend that processes are in place within your organization to notify the user who is responsible for publishing the vacancy of its approval status after it has been submitted for approval. Regardless of whether such processes are in place, email notifications are sent when a vacancy is approved.

#### Approving a Vacancy by Email

1.  Access the  Approving of Vacancy  page for the vacancy as part of the last step in creating a vacancy.  
    - or -  
    After a vacancy has been created, from the  Edit Vacancy  tab, click on the icon with a pencil for the  Approving of Vacancy  option.
2.  Select the approver from the  Recipient  list, make any edits required to the content of the email then click  Save.  
    Do not change the  <project /> or <approval-link />  tags in the email. These are required for the approval process to function correctly.
3.  Click  OK  in the confirmation message box to send the email to the approver.
4.  The approver must click the EasyCruit link in the  Request for approval... email to access EasyCruit.
5.  The approver can view the vacancy and approve it, enabling it to be published.

#### Manually Approving a Vacancy

1.  After a vacancy has been created, from the  Edit Vacancy  tab click on the icon with a pencil for the  Edit Approval Status  option.
2.  Select  Yes  to approve the vacancy. Type any required comments, then click  Save.

The vacancy approval light is now green, indicating it is approved.

#### Viewing a Vacancy's Approval Status and History

1.  Select a vacancy then select the  Edit Vacancy  tab.
2.  Click on the icon with a green magnifying glass from the  Approving of Vacancy  option to display the approval history.

#### Overriding Vacancy Approvals

The ability to override the approval of a vacancy is dependent on the access control rights of the user. Typically this functionality is available to users with administration rights in the EasyCruit system. Vacancy approval may need to be overridden if the required approver is unavailable or the vacancy has already been published and changes need to be made and strict vacancy approval is being used. The procedure for overriding vacancy approvals is the same as that for manually approving a vacancy.
