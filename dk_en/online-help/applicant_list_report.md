# Applicant List Report

The reports available (Public candidate list  and  Extended applicant list) from the  Applicant List  tab are specific to the Norwegian market and do not apply anywhere else.

#### Public Candidate List

By default, the following details are automatically included in public reports:

-   Name,  Age,  Gender,  Home municipality  and  Position/designation

For candidates who want to be marked as confidential and excluded from the public disclosure list, selecting  Exclude reserved candidate  ensures that only their gender is displayed in the reports.

#### Extended Applicant List

Show excluded from public view message  is an additional option only available for extended reports. When selected, this text is displayed on reports requested by the candidate of a vacancy and is the only time the report should be communicated outside of the company. This wording is only displayed when the customer's country is set to Norway.

This report has to show the candidate name. However, those candidates wishing to be excluded from public disclosure are marked with the word confidential displayed next to their name. This ensures that any candidate receiving this report is aware of those candidates wishing to remain anonymous.

By default, the following details are included in extended reports:

-   Name,  Age,  Complete Overview  of education and professional experience
