# Matching Criteria for Duplicate Candidates

Matching criteria enables rules to be set up within EasyCruit to help identify duplicate applications and CVs. Potential duplicates are identified within EasyCruit and the recruiter has the opportunity to verify or dismiss the suggested match. Personal Details options and Candidate - CV Details questions can be used for matching criteria.

The criteria available to select is configured during the initial set up of the system: if any changes are required for the available fields please contact your system administrator.

By default  First Name  and  Surname  are always used as matching criteria for duplicate checking.
