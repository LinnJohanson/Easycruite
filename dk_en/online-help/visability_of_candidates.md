# Visibility of Candidates: Searching Restrictions for Non-Admin users

If an internal user is an administrator user (indicated by having the  Is Administrator  access control option enabled) then they can search for any candidates in the system. If an internal user is not an administrator user, then their search results differ as their access to the candidates in the system is limited.

For non-administrator users, CV Candidate types that are not related to a project the user has access are displayed when a candidate search is run, but because they are part of another vacancy, the user cannot transfer them to their own vacancy. Candidates that have a user name and password, but are not associated with a project are not displayed in the search results.

Candidates that are not associated with a project are returned in a search. Other Candidates that are associated with a project are only displayed if the user has access to that project.

Internal users must have the  Access to CV Search  access control setting enabled to search for candidates, regardless of whether they are administrator or non-administrator users.
