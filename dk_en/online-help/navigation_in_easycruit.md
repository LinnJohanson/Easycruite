# Navigation in EasyCruit

EasyCruit provides the features and functionality to enable an organization to improve their recruitment processes. Part of that improvement involves the EasyCruit workspace. The EasyCruit Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed to provide recruiters and administrators with easy access to the features they need to complete their daily tasks.

Regardless of the user's access level, the EasyCruit workspace is laid out in the same consistent manner.

#### Toolbar

The toolbar provides quick links to the key components that a user needs on a daily basis. The options available in the toolbar change depending on which type of user is logged in.

**Vacancy list**

The top of the  Content Pane  displays changing text information that corresponds to the task a user is performing.

From the  Start page  and the  Settings page, selecting icons will take you to the overview page for that subject. The available icons depend on the user's access level.

#### Quick Link Menus

My Projects  lists the last ten vacancies you have viewed.  My Expired Vacancies  lists your last ten expired vacancies. Beneath this are quick search links for finding an applicant by searching for their name or User CV ID.  My Requested Documents  provides links to requested documents and search templates if you have previously accessed these.

Selecting one of the vacancies displayed in  My Projects  or  My Expired Vacancies  takes the user to the  Application Handling  page for that vacancy.

#### Accessing the Workspace

Access to the workspace and its functions is dependent on a user's access right level. The objects that are accessible on the  Start page  and those on the  Settings page  can be configured using the four standard user levels or can be as highly customized as your organization requires.

The following examples for a standard complete user and a standard limited user demonstrate the differences between each user's access.

#### User Levels

There are a number of different standard user access levels in the system. Each level can be further customized, but typically they are as follows:

-   Complete access  - This user is responsible for administering the system. They create the required recruitment and system objects that are needed for recruiters to use the system. These include items such as new users, application templates, additional questions and job categories. If someone has trouble using the system, a complete access user should be the first point of contact.
-   Department Administrator access  - This user is similar to a complete access user. However, their administrative access is limited to specific departments and is not system wide. These users are created by complete access users and, once created, can create new users for their departments.
-   Mid level access  - This user represents a typical recruiter, who can create new vacancies and add candidates to the system using the recruitment objects created by a user with administrative access rights.
-   Limited access  - This user is similar to a mid level access user, but typically only has access to vacancies that they themselves have created.

To learn more about user access levels refer to  [Access Control](access_control_options.htm)  Options.
