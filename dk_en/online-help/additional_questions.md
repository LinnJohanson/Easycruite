# Additional Questions

Additional questions can be used during the recruitment process to act as screening questions or simply to apply ad hoc position-specific questions to a vacancy.

There are several different categories for additional questions, with some data being associated with a candidate and some only applying to the specific vacancy. The categories are as follows:

-   Self Classification - Candidate application  - These questions relate to the specific vacancy and the answers are not available for the candidate when applying for other vacancies. These questions are not displayed when candidates register a spontaneous CV through a career website.
-   Self Classification - Candidate profile  - These questions relate to spontaneous applications. The answers to these questions are associated with the candidate and stay with the candidate when moved between projects. These questions can be included in application templates and are also displayed when candidates register a spontaneous CV. These questions can also be used as matching criteria, which helps to ensure that the same person does not get included in the system multiple times.
-   HR Classification - Candidate profile  - These questions relate to HR administrator questions and move along with the candidate from one position to the next. These questions are displayed in the  Classification  tab which is accessible from the  Application and CV  page.
-   HR Classification - Project profile  - These questions relate to HR administrator questions and apply to the vacancy. The questions are displayed from the Classification â€“ Project Profile Questions section under  Edit Vacancy  in a project.
-   Self Classification - Employee profile  - These questions relate to hired staff. These questions are only available when registered co-workers login through the career website with their username and password.
-   HR Classification - Employee profile  - These questions are the same as standard classification questions, but relate to hired staff. This is an optional add on feature.
