# Internal Guidelines

Guidelines can be used to ensure that company policies are being followed correctly throughout the different stages of the recruitment process.

The places where Guidelines can be placed within EasyCruit are preset. When Guidelines are available in EasyCruit, they are easily identifiable by the information icon. Guidelines can contain both text information and attachments.

Any Guidelines that are created for sub-departments result in an asterisk being placed next to that department, which is visible when viewing the  Select Departments  list on the  Guidelines  page.
