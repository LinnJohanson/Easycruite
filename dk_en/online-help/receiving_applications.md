# Receiving Applications

Candidate applications can be entered into the system in different ways. The easiest way they can be entered into EasyCruit is via the company's career website. By applying for a position that is published to the company website, the applicant enters their own details, as dictated by the vacancy for which they are applying. The other method is to have manually submitted applications from potential candidates entered into EasyCruit by a recruiter. This option requires more work from EasyCruit users, but is provided to ensure that no potential applicants are left out of the system.

As soon as a vacancy is available on a career website, applicants can apply and EasyCruit begins to receive those applications.

#### Using the Company Website

The company website, which is designated as a vacancy's publishing channel during the creation process, is the main source of applications in EasyCruit. Applications that come through the website are automatically associated with the corresponding vacancy and are easily accessible from the  Application Handling  tab for a vacancy.

The options selected in EasyCruit are reflected in the application form on the website, and so controls the information that is provided by the candidate. The  Personal details  options selected below are then included with the vacancy when it is published to the vacancy website, as seen in the following image.

#### Adding a Candidate Manually

Applications that are submitted manually, such as applicants who have emailed their applications outside of EasyCruit, must be added to the system by the recruiter. The Add Candidate feature enables recruiters to manually add a candidate to a vacancy in EasyCruit. The feature can also be used to add other types of candidates, such as prospects and employees. For more information on candidate types refer to  [Candidate Types](candidate_types.htm).

1.  From the  Start  page, select  Add Candidate  to display the  Add Candidate  page.
2.  Select  Candidate  from the  Select Category  list.
3.  Select the appropriate vacancy for the candidate.
4.  Select the required department and language then click  Next.
5.  Enter the candidate details for the available tabs, such as  Personal Details,  Education  and  Experience, and  Login Information.
6.  Click  Next  when complete.  
    Ensure that the  Login information  is complete if you want the candidate to be able to access the candidate website.
7.  On the  Login Information  page click  Save  to return to the  Add Candidate  page  
    - or -  
    Click  Save  and then  Go to vacancy  to go to the  Application and CV  page for the vacancy to which the candidate has been added.  
    If the candidate has been given a username and password for the candidate website, the recruiter should not edit the candidate's details again, unless an explicit request is made.
