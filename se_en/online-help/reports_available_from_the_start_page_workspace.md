# Reports available from the Start Page workspace

EasyCruit enables you to create reports on the data associated with the application process. You can create reports on the sources to which a vacancy is posted, the reason applicants were rejected and what stages applicants are at in a vacancy.

For information related specifically to candidate reporting refer to  [Reporting on Candidates] (reporting_on_candidates.htm).

The following report types are available:

**Report Type**
