# Setting Allowable Uploadable Document and Image File Types

Documents such as CVs, references and cover letters, and also image files can be uploaded by EasyCruit users using the back office, or by applicants using a career website. You can specify which file types you want users/applicants to be able to upload to ensure that users can open and view the uploaded files. For example, you can turn off document file types that your users do not have the correct software to open.

All allowable file types will be active by default so we recommend you turn off the ones you do not wish to use.

1.  From the  Toolbar  select  Settings  then select  File Type Configuration  to display the  File Type Configuration  page.
2.  Deselect the file type you do not wish to use then click  Save.

The acceptable file types are displayed to users and applicants on EasyCruit and career site pages.
