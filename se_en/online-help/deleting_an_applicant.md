# Deleting an Applicant

1.  Select the checkbox for the applicant that is going to be deleted.
2.  From the  Further Progress  list select  Delete  then click  Execute.

## Deleted Applications

After an applicant has been deleted from a vacancy, they can be further managed from the  Deleted Applications  page. From here applications can be restored or permanently deleted (purged) from the system database.

If a deleted applicant is associated with a deleted vacancy then that applicant cannot be restored.

#### Restoring a Deleted Applicant

1.  From the  Start  page, select  Deleted Applications.
2.  Use the  Select Vacancy  and  Select Time Period  options to focus the list of deleted applicants.
3.  Select the checkbox next to the relevant applicants.
4.  Click  Restore  then click  OK  when prompted to confirm your action.
5.  Go to the vacancy the applicant was associated with. The  Status  of the applicant is now  Restored.

#### Permanently Deleting (Purging) an Application from the System

1.  From the  Start  page, select  Deleted Applications.
2.  Filter the list as required and select the checkboxes next to the relevant applicants.
3.  Click  Delete Permanently  then click  OK  when prompted to confirm the deletion.  
    
    Be absolutely sure you want to delete the application before doing so. Applications cannot be recovered from the database once this procedure is complete.
