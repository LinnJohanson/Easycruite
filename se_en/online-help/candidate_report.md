#### Requesting Reports

To ensure that a PDF report containing candidate details for a vacancy is compiled and formatted correctly, users can request a report. The reports are built in accordance with how they are set up for a vacancy's candidate report. Once reports have been created and requested, the  My Requested Documents  page is used to manage them. From that page, the reports can be viewed, deleted and update requests can be made.

#### Using the My Requested Documents List

1.  First request a report by using the  Candidate Report  tab for a vacancy.
2.  Select the  Manage Requested Documents  link in the  My Requested Documents  section on the right of the screen.  
    Completed and requested reports are displayed in a list. The Explanation of Conversion column shows the result of the report generation process; if the process does not complete successfully an error message such as "Operation timed out. Please try with fewer candidates", will display here.
3.  From this list you can:
    -   Select the  Name of the document, if the status is at  Complete.
    -   Select  Delete  to remove a document.
    -   Click  Update  for documents that are in  Pending  status.
