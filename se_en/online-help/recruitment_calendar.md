# Recruitment Calendar

The  Recruitment Calendar  is used to keep track of a recruiter's interviews and other appointments associated with candidates and vacancies.

From the  Recruitment Calendar  page you can access a candidate's application details, send the applicant an email and also filter the activity list.

While the majority of the options and fields on the page are for standard values, the two options specific to the  Recruitment Calendar  are as follows:

-   Activity  - This is the interview stage that the applicant is at and to which the recruiter needs to act upon.
