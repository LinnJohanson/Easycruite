# Application Templates

Application templates help control how a vacancy is presented to a candidate when they apply via the candidate website. It also determines what information is kept in the EasyCruit database in relation to the candidate and the application. The templates can be set up to make options mandatory, such as the applicant's name and work permit status. Questions relating to both the candidate and the vacancy can be included in the application template to help screen applicants right at the beginning of the application process.

When viewing the Setup page for an application template, it is divided into the different parts of the application form that the candidate needs to complete, such as personal details, work experience and questions. Each section contains different options and provides a description of them, as well as what type of option it is.

When selecting questions, it is important that the values for the questions have been included for all of the languages that are available in your system.
