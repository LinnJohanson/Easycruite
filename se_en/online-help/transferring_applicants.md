# Transferring Applicants

Applicants can be transferred to another vacancy or to the CV database. Transferring an applicant to another vacancy, effectively creates a new application for that vacancy. Transferring an applicant to the database makes them available in the talent pool for recruiters to search for without being associated with a specific vacancy.

#### Transferring an Applicant to Another Vacancy

1.  From the  All Applications  page, select the applicants you want to transfer, then from the  Further Progress  list select  Transfer to vacancy project  then click  Execute.  
    - or -  
    From the applicant's  Application and CV  page, select  Transfer  from the  Further Progress  list then click  Execute.  
    
2.  On the  Transfer  page, select the following:
    -   Status  - This is the status of the destination vacancy and can be  New  and  Active,  Expired  or  Closed.
    -   Vacancy  - All of the vacancies that meet the status criteria are listed.
    -   Department  - If the vacancy is associated with multiple departments then they are listed.
3.  Select  Copy this data (do not move)  if you want to copy the candidate details to the new vacancy while keeping them associated with the original vacancy as well. If you do not select this option, the candidate is transferred to the new vacancy and removed from the original vacancy.  
    
    Candidate responses to  Project Specific Questions  will not be transferred, as they are project/ vacancy specific.
    
4.  Click  Transfer.
5.  Go to the transferred applicant and from the  Application and CV  page, the applicant's  Vacancy Status  is  Transferred.

#### Transferring an Applicant to the CV Database

When an applicant is not suitable for a vacancy and there are no other vacancies to which the applicant can be transferred, they can be rejected. Once they have been rejected, they can then be transferred to the CV database. For information on transferring applicants refer to Transferring Applicants.

1.  From the  Application Handling  page, click  Transfer to CV Database.
2.  Select the  Mark/Tick  box for the applicants who are to be transferred.
3.  Select  Transfer  and click  Next.  
    - or -  
    select  Transfer  and send user name and password and click  Next  to display the email page, and then click  Send.  
    
4.  The  Application Handling  page is updated to show the applicants are now  Saved applications  and the individual applicant's status is changed to  Saved.
