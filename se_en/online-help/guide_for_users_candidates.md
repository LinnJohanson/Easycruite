# Candidates

The Candidate module is used to add and manage candidates in the system. Candidates are not strictly limited to current applicants, but can also include prospects who have submitted a spontaneous CV or the employee of an organization who may want to move internally to a new position.

A candidate may have multiple applications. We refer to a candidate who has applied to a specific position as an applicant.
