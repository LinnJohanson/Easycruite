# Export Templates

Export templates are an optional feature which provide the ability to designate what applicant information is included when exporting candidate reports. Export templates can be created from new or can be based on existing templates. This enables EasyCruit administrators to set up templates and then recruiters can simply apply the template with the appropriate settings when they export an applicant list. Checkboxes are provided for selecting which values to include in the applicant export.

For information on running an export refer to  [Reporting on Candidates](reporting_on_candidates.htm)
