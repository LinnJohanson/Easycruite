#### Configuring Default Interview Reminder Templates

To configure the default wording and settings for Interview Reminder Templates

1.  Click on  Settings  from the top menu navigation.
2.  Click on  Response Mails.
3.  Edit one of the four interview templates you want to configure a reminder for.
4.  Select one of the reminder options:
    -   No reminder  - no reminder will be sent
    -   Send email reminder  - an email reminder will be sent
    -   Send SMS reminder  - an SMS reminder will be sent if the user creating the interview has  [access to SMS](access_control_options.htm)
    -   Send SMS + email reminder  - both an SMS and email will be sent
5.  Select the number of days the reminder should be sent prior to the interview:
    -   1, 2, 3,5 or 7 days  
        Reminders are sent at approximately 09:00 CET prior to the interview. Days are calculated on weekdays and weekends - therefore if an interview was set for Monday, and a reminder for 2 days prior, the reminder would be sent on Saturday at 09:00. No reminder can be sent if the interview is less than the number of days configured for the reminder.
6.  If you have selected to send an email reminder:
    -   Enter the  Subject.
    -   Enter the  Contents.
    -   Enter the  Signature.
7.  Enter the  Contents  of the SMS reminder (if you have selected to send an SMS reminder)  
    SMS reminders have a maximum number of characters that can be sent. If you are using merge fields please take into consideration that the merge field will be replaced with the actual text and may contain more characters.
8.  Click  Save.
