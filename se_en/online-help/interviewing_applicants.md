# Interviewing Applicants

After reviewing an applicant's application, those people that have the required skills can be invited for an interview. This could be a phone interview, person to person interview or group interview and could be the first step towards this candidate being selected for the vacancy.

#### Inviting Applicants for an Interview

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link to display the  Overview of Vacancies page.
2.  Select the  Title  of the vacancy for which you want to schedule interviews to display the  Application Handling  page.
3.  From the  Overview  section, select  All Applications  to display the list of applicants.
4.  Select the checkbox for the required applicant, then from the  Further Progress  list select  Invite to Interview  and click  Execute.
5.  Select the  Type of Interview,  Recruiters attending interview,  Date,  Time  and  Duration  then click  Next.
6.  Confirm that all of the details are correct for the email that will be sent to the applicant then click  Send.  
    Ensure that the  Action  option is set to  Send email  for the applicants to receive email notification of their interview. Also consider selecting the link confirmation option to enable the applicant to verify the meeting.
7.  You are returned to the  Applications  page and the applicant's status is updated to indicate they have been invited for an interview.

#### Confirm link Considerations

The inclusion of the  {confirmlink}  tag in an email ensures that the candidate can respond properly to an interview invitation.

The  Would you like to include a link... option guarantees that a confirmation link is included in the email. Whether this option is selected by default depends on certain criteria as follows:

The email is sent to a single candidate

-   If the  Contents  section of the email contains  {confirmlink}, the option is not selected.
-   If the  Contents  section of the email does not contain  {confirmlink}, the option is selected by default.

The email is sent to multiple candidates who speak different languages

-   If the  Contents  section of the email in each language variant contains  {confirmlink}, the option is not selected.
-   If the  Contents  section of the email for any language does not contain  {confirmlink}, the option is selected by default.

#### Sending Interview Reminders

Interview reminders are set up from the same page that you send an interview to a candidate.

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link to display the  Overview of Vacancies  page.
2.  Select the  Title  of the vacancy for which you want to schedule interviews to display the  Application Handling  page.
3.  From the  Overview  section, select  All Applications  to display the list of applicants.
4.  Select the checkbox for the required applicant, then from the  Further Progress  list select  Invite to Interview  and click  Execute.
5.  Select the  Type of Interview,  Recruiters attending interview,  Date,  Time  and  Duration  then click  Next.
6.  Review information for the interview interview invitation including  From Address,  Subject,  Contents.  
    If you do not want to send a candidate an interview invitation, but just a reminder, set the interview invitation to  No Email.
7.  Select one of the reminder options
    -   No reminder  - no reminder will be sent
    -   Send email reminder  - an email reminder will be sent
    -   Send SMS reminder  - an SMS reminder will be sent if the user creating the interview has access to SMS. This option will not be visible to users who do not have  [access to SMS](users_access_controls.htm).
    -   Send SMS + email reminder  - both an SMS and email will be sent. This option will not be visible to users who do not have access to SMS.
8.  Select the number of days the reminder should be sent prior to the interview:
    
    -   1, 2, 3,5 or 7 days
    
    Reminders are sent at approximately 09:00 CET prior to the interview. Days are calculated on weekdays and weekends - therefore if an interview was set for Monday, and a reminder for 2 days prior, the reminder would be sent on Saturday at 09:00. No reminder can be sent if the interview is less than the number of days configured for the reminder.
9.  If you have selected to send an email reminder:
    -   Enter the  Subject.
    -   Enter the  Contents.
    -   Enter the  Signature.
10.  Click  Send.  
    A warning will appear if you try to send an SMS reminder to a candidate who does not have a mobile phone number entered.

#### Applicants and the Interview Process

Once an applicant has been invited for an interview, they need to respond to the email invitation so that the system can be updated accordingly. The email that the applicant receives contains the required details that are automatically inserted into the body of the email to replace the variables that are included in the email template.

When the applicant clicks on the interview confirmation link, they are taken to another web page where they can respond, which updates their status in EasyCruit. The following table indicates what each confirmation option results in. The  Acc.time  status is indicated in the  Recruitment calendar  and the  Editing meeting invitation  status is indicated on the candidate's  Application and CV  page.

**Confirmation Option**
Acc. Time/Edit Meeting Invition Status

**Yes, I will attend**
Accepted

**No, I cannot attend**
Not accepted

**Contact me for new appointment**
Contact for new date/time

**Please withdraw my application**
Not applicable. The candidate's  Vacancy Status  is updated to  Withdrawn.

Depending on the applicant's response, the interview can take place and their status can be subsequently updated after the interview.
