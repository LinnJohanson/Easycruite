# CV Parsing

CV Parsing saves candidates time and increases the conversion rate of applications, as candidates do not have to manually enter their personal information in the Application Form. CV Parsing provides the ability for candidates to upload their CV/resume file from their Dropbox, Google Drive account or computer, which will be converted into structured data that pre-fills the Application Form. The structured information once submitted with the application is easily searchable by the users.

## List of questions that can be prefilled

The following information will be populated if the candidate has the information in their CV file, and the question is included in the application form or Career Center CV form:
