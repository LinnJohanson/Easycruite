# Vacancy Folder

Folders are available in the system to upload documents and add notes for specific vacancies. Project folders can be accessed by any users who have access to the vacancy.

To access the folder, click on the pencil icon in the right navigation pane.

Each file uploaded to the Project Folder is limited to 2mb. For information about increasing this limit (up to 10mb) speak to your Account representative.
