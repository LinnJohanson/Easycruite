# Rejecting and Withdrawing an Applicant

#### Rejecting an Applicant

When an applicant is not suitable for a vacancy and there are no other vacancies to which the applicant can be transferred, they can be rejected. Once they have been rejected, they can then be transferred to the CV database. For information on transferring applicants refer to  [Transferring Applicants](transferring_applicants.htm).

1.  From the  Application Handling  page, select  All applications  to display the  Applicants list.
2.  Select the  Name  of the applicant to be rejected. The  Application and CV  page is displayed.
3.  From the  Further Progress  list, select  Rejection  then click  Execute.
4.  From the  Reject Type  list, select the stage at which the rejection is occurring.  
    The selected rejection type has a corresponding rejection type email template.
5.  From the  Reason  list, select the reason for the rejection then click  Next.
6.  The email page displays the appropriate template and enables it to be edited if required before sending it to the applicant.
7.  Click  Send. The email is sent and the applicant's Application and CV page is updated to display accurate Vacancy Status and  Job Offer Sent  information.

The  Application Handling  page for the vacancy is also updated to show that the applicant has been rejected and at what stage the rejection occurred.

#### Withdrawing an Applicant

1.  From the applicant's  Application and CV  page, select  Withdrawn  from the  Further Progress  list then click  Execute. The applicant's  Vacancy Status  is updated to  Withdrawn.

An applicant can withdraw from the application process themselves by selecting the Please withdraw my application option when responding to an interview invitation.

#### Non-Rejected Applicants

For those applicants that have not been rejected, but do not receive a job offer, there are a number of different options available for dealing with them. For applicants that could be successful prospects for other vacancies, they can transferred directly to a vacancy or can have their details saved to the CV database. Other applicants could be withdrawn from a vacancy or deleted.

For information on transferring an applicant to another vacancy or the database refer to  [Transferring Applicants](transferring_applicants.htm).
