# Job Categories

Job categories are used on vacancy websites to help the candidate search for vacancies that are most applicable to them. This makes the vacancy websites easier for the candidate to use, as they can focus their searches and filter out jobs in which they are not interested.

While job categories are empty by default, to enable them to be tailored to an organization's internal structure, EasyCruit recommends a typical implementation using the categories as detailed below. There are three different types of categories that can have items assigned to them:

-   Sector  - We suggest this category should refer to different vocations, such as administration, training, or sales.
-   Job Level  - We suggest this category should refer to hierarchical levels, such as experienced, manager, or graduate.
-   Position Type  - We suggest this category should refer to position types, such as full time, part time, permanent or contract.

During the vacancy creation process these three values can be selected by a recruiter from the  Publish2Board/Publish2Print/Multi Posting  option.

#### Creating a Job Category Type

1.  From the  Toolbar  click  Settings  then  Job Categories.
2.  Select one of the following options:
    -   Sector,  Job Level  or  Position Type
3.  Click  Add new Category Item.
4.  Enter the name for the category for each available language then click  Add.
5.  Click  Save  to confirm the new job category.  
    If a job category value is missing for the current system language a missing translation message is displayed.
