# Employment Contracts

Employment contract objects are used to create templates that can be associated with a certain type of vacancy. This enables those employees within a company that are responsible for creating contracts to enter them into EasyCruit, making them available for recruiters to include in their correspondence with successful applicants. Like some of the other recruitment objects in the system, the list of employment contracts can be filtered on a department basis.

To ensure that the correct details are included in an employment contract, XML variables are used. These variables include the fields and options that an applicant needs to enter when initially applying for a vacancy. When an employment contract is then sent out by a recruiter the XML variables are automatically replaced by EasyCruit with the values associated with the applicant.

#### Creating an Employment Contract

1.  From the  Toolbar  click  Settings  then  Employment contracts  to display the  Employment contracts  page.
2.  Where applicable, from the  Select Department  list select any sub departments that have access to the contract.
3.  Click  New Employment Contract  to display the  New Employment Contract  page.
4.  Enter a title in the  Employment Contract Title  field.
5.  In the  Employment Contract  section, enter the required content for the contract:
    -   Right-click where you want to place an XML variable. The shortcut menu of available variables is displayed. Select the variable to place it in the contract.
    -   Use copy and paste actions with the keyboard to include existing text in the employment contract, or simply type the required content.
6.  Click  Preview  to see a preview of the contract then click  Save  when the contract is complete.

#### Creating Self-Defined XML Variables

1.  From the bottom of the  New/Edit employment contract  page, click  Get XML Tags  to display the XML variables window.
2.  Click  New XML-variable  to display the  Self defined XML-variables  fields.
3.  Enter the required values, and then click  Add new XML variable.  
    The self defined variable can now be selected and included in the employment contract by clicking the include arrow. The variable can also be edited or deleted by accessing the XML variable window. Ensure that tags are not included in an employment contract before deletion, otherwise an Invalid Tag error is displayed when the corresponding contract is next saved.

#### Editing or Viewing an Existing Employment Contract

1.  From the  Toolbar  click  Settings  then  Employment contracts  to display the  Employment contracts  page.
2.  Click icon with a pencil for the corresponding template, and then make the any required modifications then click  Save  when complete.
