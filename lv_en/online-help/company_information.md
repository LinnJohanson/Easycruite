# Company Information

Company information provides the highest level of information regarding your organization within EasyCruit.

These values can be used to provide content within vacancies that are listed on the candidate website. To ensure that there are no empty placeholders where content should be, all of the required fields and options for company information must have values entered for them.

Company information includes such details as company addresses, privacy policies and corporate logos. If information does not exist at the department level for a vacancy, then the information is inherited from the parent  [department](departments.htm).
