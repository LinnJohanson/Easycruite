# Tracking Source Channels from Ad Hoc Postings

You can track the source of applications received from any posting channel by adding a "source" to the URL you send to external sourcing channels.

1.  To identify the source channel as, for example, LinkedIn, type the parameter "&source=linkedin" to the end of the URL.
2.  Send your enhanced application URL to LinkedIn (or whichever external sourcing channel you are using).

In EasyCruit, candidates who apply by clicking your enhanced URL will have their  Application source  set to the sourcing channel you specified.

[Click here for the list of sourcing channels that are available to use as source parameter](visma_easycruit_sourcing_channels.xlsx). If the sourcing channel you require is not in this list please contact the Customer Success Team at  [support.easycruit@visma.com](mailto:support.easycruit@visma.com).

The source parameter can be used in the application URL of a vacancy posted to a career website or external posting channel.

The source parameter can also be added to the vacancy job description URL and will be automatically added to the application form when a candidate clicks on the  Apply  button.

#### Another Example  

Another way you might use this feature is to run a banner campaign or event for a vacancy that is posted to your career website.

1.  To run the campaign on Altinget.dk website add the source parameter "&source=altinget" to the job description URL.
2.  When you publish the job on Altinget.dk website use this enhanced job description URL.

Candidates who apply using the enhanced URL will have the application source set to "Altinget.dk".
