# Department Administrator Users

Department administrator functionality is beneficial for larger companies, as it provides a simple, scalable solution to delegate and compartmentalize specific administrative responsibilities within an organization. This means that a company's EasyCruit implementation is not always reliant on one or two high level administrators to manage the entire system.

EasyCruit users, given department administrator access, have administrator level user rights for specific departments (but not their sub departments). Users with department administrator access can create new users, edit the department structure, define templates for the department and have access to all vacancies and candidates in the department.

Key points regarding department administrator functionality include the following:

-   Department administrator users can view and edit vacancies (projects) associated with a department they have access to, with full administrative privileges.
-   Department administrator users have full administrative access to candidates who applied for a vacancy in a department that they have access to.
-   When searching candidates, the department administrator user can see prospects, CV candidates and employees who are associated with projects the user has access to, but are not associated with any departments.
-   At the EasyCruit administrator level, the department administrator feature can be enabled and disabled customer wide. This means if a customer no longer needs the feature it can be disabled and all department administrator users are converted to standard users.
