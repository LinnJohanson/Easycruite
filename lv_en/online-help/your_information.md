# Your Information

Your Information contains details that are specific to the user currently logged into EasyCruit.

The details are similar to those that are available via the User option, however, the details that are displayed and available to be edited are dependent on the access control rights of the user. An administrator can see their individual access rights, while a lower level user may only be able to edit their personal login details and their recruiting availability.

1.  From the  Toolbar  select  Settings  then select  Your Information.
2.  At the bottom of the page click  Edit  to enable the tabs to be edited.
