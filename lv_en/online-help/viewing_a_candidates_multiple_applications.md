# Viewing a Candidate's Multiple Applications

To help progress an applicant, an EasyCruit system can be configured to provide recruiters with the ability to see multiple applications from a single candidate at the same time.

This is an optional feature and requires configuration by the EasyCruit Customer Success Team.

Depending on the system configuration, internal users can

-   view all of the applications a candidate has made across an entire company

or

-   the internal user can only view those applications made for vacancies in departments the user has access to.

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link and select a vacancy to display the  Application Handling  page.
2.  Click  All Applications  then click 'eye' in the  Application Overview  column.
3.  The  Application Overview  window displays the other vacancies the candidate has applied for and what status the applicant is at.

The vacancies that are displayed include the current vacancy.
