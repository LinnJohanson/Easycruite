# Searching for Candidates

After candidates have been added to the system, recruiters can make use of the search functionality to find potential applicants for their vacancies. The values that can be used as search parameters are dependent on how your system has been configured.

The searches a user has access to are dependent on their access levels.

Typically there are three different ways in which a search can be run:

-   Simple Searches - These searches are best used when the recruiter knows who they are looking for, as the search criteria is limited to categories, name, and when the candidate was added to the system.
-   Advanced Searches - These searches extend the searching functionality to include the application form sections that have been configured to have their values made searchable. These searches are useful for finding candidates that have certain skills. Advanced searches also provide the ability to use search templates, as well as saved searches.
-   CV User ID/Candidate Names - These static options are available from the right side of the page. These should be used when you know the candidate's name or ID and are looking to quickly return the relevant person.

For details on search parameters and how to get the results you are looking for refer to  [Search Criteria Considerations](searching_criteria_considerations_and_examples.htm).
