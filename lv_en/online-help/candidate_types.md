# Candidate Types

The following types of candidate exist in EasyCruit.

**Candidate Category**
Description

**Candidate**
This type associates the applicant directly with a vacancy and a department. Users must have access to the vacancy to see the applicant's details.

**CV Candidate**
This is an applicant who has not applied for a specific vacancy, but who has expressed an interest in working for the company. Candidates who first or only create a Candidate Career Center login will appear as this type. When a candidate subsequently applies for a specific vacancy through the Candidate Career Center, their type will remain as CV candidate. Their details can be viewed by anyone in the system.

**Employee**
This type has gone through the recruitment process in EasyCruit and has subsequently been hired for a vacancy. Alternatively they can be manually created.

**Prospect**
This type can be associated with a specific vacancy, however, unlike a candidate their details can be viewed by anyone in the system. Prospects are never deleted through the automatic deletion.

**Saved**
This type has been saved in the system. This may be desired so that their details can be viewed by anyone in the system.

There is an optional setting available which save all candidates who apply through an application form so that they are visible by anyone in the system. This can be activated by a member of the EasyCruit Success Team.
