# Closing a Vacancy

Closing a vacancy is done after a candidate has been hired or the vacancy is no longer required. After a vacancy has been closed, ensure that all of the candidates that were associated with the vacancy are notified.

Once a vacancy is listed as closed it can be restored if required. Only administrators can restore closed vacancies (even those which have expired).

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link to display the  Overview of Vacancies  page.
2.  Click the  Close  icon for the required vacancy then click  OK  when prompted to confirm your action.
3.  Click  OK  in the external channels message box if there are no external channels associated with the vacancy.  
    If there are external channels associated with the vacancy you must click  Cancel  then edit the vacancy to remove the channel. This is done using the  Publish/Posting  option on the  Edit Vacancy  page.
4.  Select the  Completed  tab to view the vacancy and confirm that it has been closed.
