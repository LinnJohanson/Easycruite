# Deleting a Vacancy

Deleting vacancies should only be done after serious consideration. If you simply do not want the vacancy active any longer, then close the vacancy. Deleting not only removes the vacancy, but also removes the details of any applicants that applied for the vacancy. To retain the applicant's information, they should be transferred to another vacancy.

1.  Select the  Vacancy List  quick link.
2.  Click on the icon with a trashcan for the required vacancy then click OK when prompted to delete the vacancy.

If there are applicants associated with the vacancy it should not be deleted. The applicant's details and history of their application for the vacancy are deleted and no record of their application exists.
