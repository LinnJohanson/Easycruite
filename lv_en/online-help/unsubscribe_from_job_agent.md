# Unsubscribe from Job Agent

Among the many merge fields available to use in response emails, you can include an unsubscribe from job agent link. This enables applicants to unsubscribe directly from a job agent email without having to update their profile settings.

1.  To include the unsubscribe from job agent link, insert the merge field {unsubscribe-link} in the body of the email where you want the link to appear.

When applicants click the link, a notification is displayed to verify that they have been unsubscribed from future emails. If the applicant decides to resubscribe they can do this by logging in and editing their email preferences.
