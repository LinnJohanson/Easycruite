# Integration/APIs

## Overview

The EasyCruit web application provides a customer access to their data via a web service (WS) interface. This interface can be used by customers to programmatically retrieve their data. The data can then be further processed or imported into archiving, ERP or HRM systems.

The EasyCruit WS interface is exposed in a WSDL file. This means a software development kit may be used to automatically generate code to interact with the interface.

Accessing this interface involves sending a SOAP message containing an XML document over HTTPS to the EasyCruit system. The secure HTTPS protocol guarantees the data cannot be read in transfer by third parties.

Usage of industry standards like SOAP, XML and WSDL leveraging excellent tool support, hence easy integration.

## Enabling Web Service Access

A customer desiring to have access to the EasyCruit Web Service needs to request this additional service from their Account Manager.
